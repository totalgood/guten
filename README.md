# Guten

A well-read bot!

## Description

A bot that has read all of the Gutenberg project texts and several other large high-quality text repositories. Hopefully this will give it the vocabulary, if not the personality and intelligence of professional human writers.

## PyScaffold Rocks!

This project was set up using PyScaffold. See [pyscaffold.readthedocs.org](http://pyscaffold.readthedocs.org/) to find out how you too can build your stuff with good scaffolding.
